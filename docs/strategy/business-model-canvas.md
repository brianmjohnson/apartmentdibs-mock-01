## What is a Business Model Canvas?

The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management template developed by Strategyzer that describes, designs, and pivots your business model. It consists of 9 fundamental building blocks that show the logic of how a company intends to make money.

**When to Use**:

- During initial product planning (Phase 1)
- When pivoting or adjusting business strategy
- Before fundraising to articulate value proposition
- Quarterly reviews to ensure alignment

**Process**:

1. Product Manager Agent reads `README.md`
2. Extracts business plan elements
3. Maps to Business Model Canvas structure
4. Outputs this document for human review
5. Human refines and approves
6. Document evolves with business strategy

- [ ] Are they distinct enough to require different:
  - Value propositions?

  - Relationships?
  - Revenue streams?

### Segment Types

#### Mass Market

- Business model makes no distinction between customer segments
- Value propositions, channels, and relationships all focus on one large group
- Similar needs and problems

#### Niche Market

- Value propositions, channels, and relationships tailored to specific needs

#### Segmented

- Distinguish between market segments with slightly different needs and problems
- Example: Bank serving both retail and business customers

#### Diversified

- Serve two or more unrelated customer segments with very different needs
- Example: Amazon (e-commerce + AWS)

#### Multi-Sided Platforms

- Serve two or more interdependent customer segments
- Both segments needed for business model to work

#### Variable Costs (Per Customer)

| Category           | Per User/Month | Notes                       |
| ------------------ | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| Infrastructure     | $[X]           | Compute, storage, bandwidth |
| Transaction Fees   | $[X]           | Payment processing          |
| Support Costs      | $[X]           | Customer support hours      |
| Third-party APIs   | $[X]           | External service costs      |
| **TOTAL VARIABLE** | **$[X]**       | Cost per customer           |

#### Cost by Business Model Component

**Key Resources Costs**:

- Technology infrastructure: $[X]/month
- Human resources: $[Y]/month
- Intellectual property: $[Z]/month
- Total: $[Total]/month

**Key Activities Costs**:

- Product development: $[X]/month
- Sales & marketing: $[Y]/month
- Customer support: $[Z]/month
- Total: $[Total]/month

**Key Partnerships Costs**:

- [Partner type]: $[X]/month
- [Partner type]: $[Y]/month
- Total: $[Total]/month

#### Cost Optimization Strategy

**Economies of Scale Opportunities**:

1. [How costs decrease as we grow]
2. [What thresholds matter]
3. [Where we can negotiate volume discounts]

**Economies of Scope Opportunities**:

1. [How we can leverage resources across segments]
2. [What shared infrastructure can serve multiple products]

**Cost Reduction Initiatives**:

- **Near-term** (Next 3 months):
  - [ ] [Initiative 1]: Save $[X]/month
  - [ ] [Initiative 2]: Save $[Y]/month

- **Medium-term** (3-12 months):
  - [ ] [Initiative 3]: Save $[X]/month
  - [ ] [Initiative 4]: Save $[Y]/month

**Business Model Classification**:

- [ ] Cost-Driven: Minimize costs, automate, outsource
- [ ] Value-Driven: Focus on value creation, premium service
- [ ] Hybrid: Balance cost efficiency with value delivery

## Validation & Iteration

### Validation Questions

For each canvas block, ask:

- [ ] **Assumptions**: What assumptions are we making?
- [ ] **Evidence**: What evidence supports this?
- [ ] **Risks**: What could invalidate this?
- [ ] **Tests**: How can we test this hypothesis?

### Iteration Process

1. **Initial Draft** (Phase 1)
   - Product Manager Agent generates from README.md
   - Human reviews and refines

2. **Quarterly Review**
   - Review actual vs. planned
   - Update based on learnings
   - Adjust strategy as needed

3. **Pivot Indicators**
   - Customer segments not responding
   - Value proposition not resonating
   - Channels not performing
   - Unit economics not working
   - Competition changing landscape

### Success Metrics

Track alignment between canvas and reality:

| Canvas Block      | Hypothesis              | Actual                          | Status       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Customer Segments | [Planned segment]       | [Actual users]                  | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ |
| Value Proposition | [Planned value]         | [What customers actually value] | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ |
| Channels          | [Planned CAC: $X]       | [Actual CAC: $Y]                | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ |
| Revenue Streams   | [Planned ARPU: $X]      | [Actual ARPU: $Y]               | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ |
| Cost Structure    | [Planned cost/user: $X] | [Actual cost/user: $Y]          | ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ |

## Integration with Development Process

### Phase 1: Business Planning

- **Create** this canvas from README.md
- **Review** with stakeholders
- **Validate** key assumptions

### Phase 2: User Stories

- User stories should map to value propositions
- Features should enable key activities
- Stories should serve identified customer segments

### Phase 3: Architecture (ADRs)

- ADRs should support key resources and activities
- Technology choices should align with cost structure
- Architecture should enable scalability assumptions

### Phase 4-6: Implementation & QA

- Build features that deliver value propositions
- Optimize for cost structure targets
- Measure against canvas hypotheses

### Phase 7: Session Summary

- Report progress against canvas metrics
- Document learnings that might require canvas updates
- Flag assumptions that need revisiting
