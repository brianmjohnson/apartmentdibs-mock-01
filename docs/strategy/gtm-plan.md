## What is a Go-To-Market Plan?

A Go-To-Market (GTM) plan is your strategic blueprint for bringing your product to market and achieving sustainable growth. It answers:

- **Who** are we targeting? (ICP)
- **How** will we reach them? (Acquisition)
- **What** gets them to first value? (Activation)
- **Why** will they stay? (Retention)
- **When** will they bring others? (Referral)
- **Where** are we going? (Growth metrics & phases)

**Framework**: Based on Dave McClure's AARRR (Pirate Metrics) framework, adapted for 2025 SaaS best practices.

## Activation Strategy

### What is Activation?

Activation is the moment when a new user experiences the core value of your product for the first time - the "Aha!" moment.

**Examples**:

- Slack: Team sends 2,000 messages
- Dropbox: User saves first file and accesses from another device
- Airbnb: User books first stay
- LinkedIn: User makes 5+ connections

### Finding Your Activation Metric

**Questions to Answer**:

- [ ] What action indicates a user "gets it"?
- [ ] What correlates strongest with retention?
- [ ] What behavior separates active from inactive users?
- [ ] What can users accomplish in first session?

**Validation Method**:

1. Cohort users by action completed
2. Measure 30-day retention for each cohort
3. Find action with highest retention correlation
4. That's your activation metric

## Retention Strategy

### Why Retention Matters

Retention is the most important growth metric:

- 5% increase in retention → 25-95% increase in profits
- Acquiring new customer = 5-25x more expensive than retaining existing
- Retained customers have higher LTV
- Retention powers word-of-mouth growth

## Referral & Viral Growth

### Why Referral Matters

Referral/viral growth compounds your acquisition:

- Lower CAC (or free)
- Higher quality users (referred users retain better)
- Trust signal (recommendations from friends)
- Sustainable growth engine

**Viral Coefficient (K-factor)**:

- K < 1: Each user brings less than 1 new user (need paid acquisition)
- K = 1: Each user brings 1 new user (organic growth)
- K > 1: Each user brings more than 1 user (viral growth)

**Formula**: K = (# invites sent per user) × (conversion rate of invites)

### Viral Growth Framework

```

### Types of Viral Growth

#### 1. Inherent Virality (Product-Driven)

Product naturally exposes non-users to value.

**Examples**:

- Zoom: Each meeting exposes non-users
- Dropbox: Shared folders
- Figma: Design sharing
- Calendly: Scheduling links
- Notion: Public pages

**Strategy**:

```markdown
### Inherent Viral Loop

**Core Sharing Mechanic**:
[What feature naturally exposes non-users?]

**Share Friction**:

- Sharing is: [Easy / Medium / Hard]
- Non-user experience: [What they see]
- Value preview: [Do they see value before signing up?]
- Conversion rate: [X%] of exposed users sign up

**Optimization**:

- [ ] Make sharing dead simple (1 click)
- [ ] Show clear value to non-users
- [ ] Reduce friction to sign up
- [ ] Track who referred whom

**Metrics**:

- Shares per active user: [X]
- Share-to-signup rate: [Y%]
- Viral coefficient (K): [Z]
- Viral cycle time: [W days]
```

#### 2. Incentivized Referrals

Give users a reason to refer others.

**Examples**:

- Dropbox: Extra storage for referrals
- Airbnb: Travel credits
- Uber: Ride credits
- PayPal: Cash bonuses (early days)

**Strategy**:

```markdown
### Incentivized Referral Program

**Two-Sided Incentive**:

- Referrer gets: [Reward for referring]
- Referee gets: [Reward for signing up]

**Reward Structure**:

- Type: [Credits / Cash / Features / Storage]
- Value: $[X] or [Y units]
- Timing: [When delivered]
- Limits: [Max referrals or rewards]

**Economics**:

- Reward cost: $[X] per referral
- Conversion rate: [Y%] of referred sign up
- Effective CAC: $[Z] (cost / converted users)
- LTV of referred users: $[W]
- ROI: [W/Z ratio]

**Referral Flow**:

1. User gets unique referral link/code
2. Shares via [email, social, direct link]
3. Referee signs up using link
4. Both receive reward when [condition met]
5. Track and attribute in database

**Promotion**:

- In-app: [Where shown]
- Email: [When sent]
- Celebration: [When user refers successfully]

**Metrics**:

- Referral rate: [X%] of users refer
- Referred users/referrer: [Y]
- Referred user conversion: [Z%]
- Viral coefficient (K): [W]

**Anti-Fraud**:

- [ ] Detect self-referrals
- [ ] Limit to real usage
- [ ] Verify email/identity
- [ ] Cap rewards per user
```

#### 3. Word-of-Mouth (WOM)

Organic sharing because product is great.

**Drivers**:

- Remarkable product
- Exceptional experience
- Community/identity
- Social proof

**Strategy**:

```markdown

- Promoters: [Y%] (score 9-10)
- Passives: [Z%] (score 7-8)
- Detractors: [W%] (score 0-6)

**NPS Follow-up**:

- Ask: "Why did you give this score?"
- Promoters → Ask for referral
- Passives → What would make it a 10?
- Detractors → Investigate and fix
```

## Revenue & Growth Metrics

### Unit Economics

**Critical Metrics**:

```markdown
### Unit Economics Dashboard

| Metric                              | Current    | Target | Status   |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ | -------- |
| **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost) | $[X]       | $[Y]   | ✅/⚠️/❌ |
| **LTV** (Customer Lifetime Value)   | $[X]       | $[Y]   | ✅/⚠️/❌ |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio**                   | [X]:1      | 3:1    | ✅/⚠️/❌ |
| **Payback Period**                  | [X] months | <12 mo | ✅/⚠️/❌ |
| **Gross Margin**                    | [X%]       | >70%   | ✅/⚠️/❌ |

#### CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)

**Formula**:
CAC = (Sales + Marketing Costs) / New Customers Acquired

**Breakdown by Channel**:
| Channel | Monthly Spend | Customers | CAC |
|---------|---------------|-----------|-----|
| [Channel 1] | $[X] | [Y] | $[Z] |
| [Channel 2] | $[X] | [Y] | $[Z] |
| **Blended CAC** | **$[Total]** | **[Total]** | **$[Avg]\*\* |

**Target CAC**: $[X] (<⅓ of LTV)

#### LTV (Customer Lifetime Value)

**Formula**:
LTV = (ARPU × Gross Margin) / Churn Rate

**Example Calculation**:

- ARPU: $[X]/month
- Gross Margin: [Y%]
- Churn Rate: [Z%]/month
- LTV = ($[X] × [Y%]) / [Z%] = $[Result]

**LTV by Segment**:
| Segment | ARPU | Churn | LTV |
|---------|------|-------|-----|
| [Segment 1] | $[X] | [Y%] | $[Z] |
| [Segment 2] | $[X] | [Y%] | $[Z] |

**Target LTV**: $[X] (>3× CAC)

#### LTV:CAC Ratio

**Interpretation**:

- <1:1 = Losing money on each customer
- 1:1 - 3:1 = Challenging unit economics
- 3:1 - 5:1 = Healthy (target range)
- > 5:1 = Potentially under-investing in growth

**Current Ratio**: [X]:1
**Target Ratio**: 3:1 minimum

#### Payback Period

**Formula**:
Payback Period = CAC / (ARPU × Gross Margin)

**Current Payback**: [X] months
**Target**: <12 months (ideally <6)

**Why It Matters**: How long until you recover acquisition cost
```

### Growth Metrics (SaaS)

```markdown
### SaaS Metrics Dashboard

| **ARR** (Annual Recurring Revenue)  | $[X]    | $[Y]       | [+Z%]  | $[W]   |
| **ARPU** (Average Revenue Per User) | $[X]    | $[Y]       | [+Z%]  | $[W]   |
| **Active Users**                    | [X]     | [Y]        | [+Z%]  | [W]    |
| **Paying Users**                    | [X]     | [Y]        | [+Z%]  | [W]    |

#### MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)

**Components**:

- Churned MRR: -$[V] (cancellations)
- **Net New MRR**: $[Total]

**MRR Growth Rate**: [X%] MoM
**Target**: [Y%] MoM

#### ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)

**Calculation**: MRR × 12 = $[X]

**ARR Milestones**:

- [ ] $10K ARR
- [ ] $100K ARR
- [ ] $1M ARR
- [ ] $10M ARR

**Current ARR**: $[X]
**Target ARR** (12 months): $[Y]

#### ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)

**Calculation**: MRR / Active Paying Users

**ARPU by Tier**:
| Tier | Users | Revenue | ARPU |
|------|-------|---------|------|
| Free | [X] | $0 | $0 |
| Starter | [X] | $[Y] | $[Z] |
| Pro | [X] | $[Y] | $[Z] |
| Enterprise | [X] | $[Y] | $[Z] |
| **Blended ARPU** | **[Total]** | **$[Total]** | **$[Avg]\*\* |

**Target ARPU**: $[X]

**ARPU Expansion Strategies**:

1. [ ] Upsell to higher tiers
2. [ ] Add-ons and premium features
3. [ ] Usage-based pricing increases
4. [ ] Annual prepay incentives
```

### Growth Accounting

```markdown
### Growth Accounting (Monthly)

**Quick Ratio** = (New MRR + Expansion MRR) / (Churned MRR + Contraction MRR)

**Interpretation**:

- <1 = Shrinking
- 1-2 = Slow growth
- 2-4 = Good growth
- > 4 = Excellent growth

**Current Quick Ratio**: [X]
**Target**: >2

**Monthly Change Breakdown**:
| Component | Amount | % of Total MRR |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Starting MRR | $[X] | 100% |
| + New MRR | $[Y] | [Z%] |
| + Expansion MRR | $[Y] | [Z%] |
| + Reactivation MRR | $[Y] | [Z%] |
| - Contraction MRR | -$[Y] | -[Z%] |
| - Churned MRR | -$[Y] | -[Z%] |
| **Ending MRR** | **$[X]** | **[Growth%]\*\* |

**Net Revenue Retention (NRR)**:
NRR = (Starting MRR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) / Starting MRR

**Current NRR**: [X%]
**Target NRR**: >100% (expansion > churn)
```
